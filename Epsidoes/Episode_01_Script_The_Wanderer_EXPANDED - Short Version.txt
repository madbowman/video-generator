[SCENE 1: DAWN IN THE FOREST]

The first rays of morning light filtered through the ancient canopy of the gnome forest, painting everything in shades of gold and green.
Somewhere deep within the tangle of roots and branches, hidden from any larger creature's view, the village of Roothollow was just beginning to stir.
Smoke curled lazily from chimney holes carved into hillsides and tree trunks, carrying the scent of mushroom stew and fresh-baked acorn bread.
The forest was alive with sound: birds singing their morning songs, squirrels chattering in the branches, and the distant rhythm of Master Cogsworth's hammer already ringing from the inventor's workshop.

[SCENE 2: VILLAGE AWAKENING]

Roothollow was a village of perhaps one hundred gnomes, their homes built seamlessly into the natural landscape.
Tree roots had been hollowed and expanded into cozy dwellings, hillsides carved with round doors and windows, platforms built high in the branches connected by rope bridges.
Everything was scaled to gnome size, which meant a human stumbling through would likely miss the village entirely, mistaking carved doorways for animal burrows and rope bridges for fallen vines.
This was intentional, of course, because while gnomes loved their forest home, they preferred to remain unnoticed by larger folk.

[SCENE 3: GNOME MORNING CHAOS]

The morning brought its usual controlled chaos to Roothollow, which was to say it brought quite a lot of chaos with only the barest pretense of control.
From the alchemist's workshop came a sudden whoosh and a puff of purple smoke, followed by Master Fernwhisk's cheerful shout of "Almost had it!"
Three young gnomes were already engaged in an elaborate game of hide-and-seek that involved climbing, illusion magic, and what appeared to be a borrowed chicken.
And somewhere in the distance, someone's experimental water wheel was making a rhythmic thumping sound that suggested it was working, just not in the way its inventor had intended.
